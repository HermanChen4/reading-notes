### My personal definition of a **Growth Mindset**
A growth mindset is a strong mental state to view your progress as always moving forward and to even take your mistakes and make them a learning lesson.
### Three reminders to maintain a growth mindset
1. Don't be too harsh on yourself 
2. Learn from others and don't envy
3. Challeges will come but perseverance is key
