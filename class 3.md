### Intro to GitHub

Git is a version control system that is useful to coders, because it allows to to see a history of allm the changes, apply view and remove those changes and is overall a useful tool for collaboration.

Github is not a git but rather an online place to share and store code. Github will track versions, review changes, and keep changes seperate until needed.

A repository is a collection of files that you've told git to pay attention to. repositories can live on both github and on your computer.
