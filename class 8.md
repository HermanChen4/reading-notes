### Intro to Operators and Loops 

## Operators 

JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.
Two of the more common operators are *Assignment operators* and *Comparison operators* 
- An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.
- An comparison operator compares the opperend to the value produced and if the statement is true another result is produced.

##Loops 
Loops are an essential way to make coding easier, by rerunning code and/or making code essentially "loop".
The different types of loops are 
-A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
