### Introduction to JavaScript

JavaSript is a lightweight interpreted compiled, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic coding language. JavaSript helps websites implement functions and is very commonly used in web development. Java and Javascript are not the same language, they have many different semantics, syntax and usage.

## JavaScript Input and Output

One usuage of JavaScript is it's input and outout functions, for ex.

This shows how a typical Html website would give the user a promt for "First name" and "Last name"
This will, in turn output a message saying "Hello 'First name' 'Last name' 

## JavaScript Variables

JavaScript will often use variables, which can be declared with by typing var, let.
Variables can also be set by the const termm which is a general rule which will not change.
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.
Variables can also be undefined by not entereing a value.
