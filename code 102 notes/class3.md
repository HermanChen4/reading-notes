### Intro to GitHub

Git is a version control system that is useful to coders, because it allows to to see a history of allm the changes, apply view and remove those changes and is overall a useful tool for collaboration.

Github is not a git but rather an online place to share and store code. Github will track versions, review changes, and keep changes seperate until needed.

A repository is a collection of files that you've told git to pay attention to. repositories can live on both github and on your computer.

Steps to keep in mind
- git status
- git add
- git commit -m "update caption" 
- git push origin main
^ this will save your local files to your github

- git pull origin main 
^ this will bring github files down to your local computer
