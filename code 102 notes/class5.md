### Intro to CSS

- CSS also known as Cascading Style Sheets is a way to bring life to a website. It brings a barebones website to a more vibrant and natural feeling website by adding color, spacing and more.

- A common way to use CSS is to apply it externally, by creating a seperate file, usually by the name style.css which you must specify and reference in your main index.html file. 

- we use curly brackets to indicate the modification {}

- To modify an element in your index you must specify what is being modified, and give the property a value. ex. I want my heading to be a specific color:
header {
  margin: 0px; 
  padding: 5px;
  background-color: white;
  text-align: center;
  }
 Here I made the background color white. The property is "header" and the value is "white"
